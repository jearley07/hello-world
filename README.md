# hello-world
My first repository on GitHub

Well this is a first!

I plan on completely learning and mastering C++ to become a Software Engineer. I want to work on productivity software and improve the lives of many either in business or day-to-day life. I plan on graduating from the University of Michigan with a Bachelor of Science - Computer Science with Software Engineering concentration. I hope to become good enough one day to be able to work for Microsoft! One can dream and take action if strongly desired!
